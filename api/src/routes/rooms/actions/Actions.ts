// Actions are pseudo-endpoints that allow consumers to execute actions on a bingo
// room. These endpoints offer simpler setup for performing actions than doing so over
// websocket, especially when the action requires access to web sessions. While websocket
// connections are allowed access to web sessions, not all consumers are eligible for or
// can maintain a web session. As much as possible, action endpoints try to send a helpful
// status and message, regardless of the outcome. However, given the nature of
// some of these actions (especially integration related actions), it is not
// always possible (or reasonable) for the endpoint to block and/or determine
// if the action was successful (success is also a fairly difficult thing to
// define in some cases). As such, the only guarantee that action endpoints make
// is that if a 4xx or 5xx code is sent, the action did not dispatch or was
// obviously unsuccessful, and that a 2xx status code indicates that the action
// was successfully dispatched for processing. The successful completion of an
// action will always result in an appropriate room update being dispatched. It
// is up to consuming applications to watch for updates via their preferred
// mechanism if they need to react to the success/completion of the action. It
// is generally not recommended to act based on the success of actions, and to
// display and act on the state of the room based on the data the server sends
// out, as that is the source of truth, and relying on manual or predicted triggers
// is very likely to result in a desync.
//
// 4xx status codes typically indicate that the action failed to dispatch to due an
// error that the client should have been able to detect, such as improper configuration
// or invalid web session state to take the action (i.e. not logged in
//
// 5xx status codes typically indicate that an error was detected while dispatching the
// action, and typically indicate an upstream problem, especially when they occur within
// actions that interact with external services.
