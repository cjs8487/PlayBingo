# PlayBingo
*The new way to bingo*

PlayBingo is a video game bingo hosting service designed to modernize,
streamline, and improve the functionality provided by
[Bingosync](https://bingosync.com), and add new features to improve the bingo
experience.

## What is video game bingo?
Video game bingo is a subset of the larger speedrun community, where rather than
aiming to simply complete the game, runners aim to complete a set of goals
within the game. These goals vary from game to game, and generally games have
many more goals than needed to fill a bingo board, creating a unique experience
every time you play.

## Setup
PlayBingo consists of two main core modules - the api module and the web module.
The api module can be run independently, but many features are unavailable
without accessing the api via a client. The web module requires the api module
for most of its functionality.

### Requirements
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- A Postgres server
  - PlayBingo is only tested against Postgres, though it should also work with
    MySQL

### Environment Variables
PlayBingo requires several environment variables to be specified in order to
function.

#### Required
##### API
- ROOM_TOKEN_SECRET is the secret key used to generate tokens for room level
  authentication
- SESSION_SECRET is the secret key used to encrypt sessions
- CLIENT_URL is the url that the web client is running at
- DATABASE_URL is the connection string for the database server

##### Web
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PATH is the url that the api service is running at
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_PATH is the url that the web socket is available at
  
#### Optional
##### API
- SMTP_HOST is the host of an SMTP mail server
- SMTP_USER is the email address of the user to send emails as using the SMTP
  server
- SMTP_PASSWORD is the password of the email account
- PORT is the port the server runs on (defaults to 8000)


### API
1. cd to the api directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file. You must provide `ROOM_TOKEN_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`,
   and `CLIENT_URL`
4. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to setup your database
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

### Web
1. cd to the web directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env.local` file and provide `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PATH`
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Modules
PlayBingo consists of several modules, which divide the functionality between
platforms, hosts, etc.

### API
The API module is the primary server module, providing the public facing API for
the application as well as the database interface. The API module also contains
the websocket layer.

### Web
The web module is PlayBingo's primary client. It provides the web interface
through which the majority of users interact with the service.

### Schema
The schema module contains json typeschema definitions for the project along
with compiled TypeScript definitions for the schemas. The types are also
available on npm in the `@bingogg/types` package.

## Database
The database includes basic seed data for the use in development environments.
This seed data includes 4 users, staff, owner, mod, and player. Staff is a user
with staff permissions, owner is an owner for all games in the seed data, mod is
a moderator for all games, and player is a basic user with no extra permissions.
The password for each account is `password`. None of the seed users have an
accessible email, anything that requires email must be done outside of the seed
data. There are 6 games included in the seed data as well. 5 of the 6 games are
SRLv5 enabled, and each game contains a varied number of goals ranging from 25
(the minimum number of goals) to 250.
